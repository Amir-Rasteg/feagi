This is a skeleton file that can serve as a starting point for a Python
console script. To run this script uncomment the following lines in the
[options.entry_points] section in setup.cfg:

    console_scripts =
         fibonacci = feagi.skeleton:run

Then run `python setup.py install` which will install the command `fibonacci`
inside your current environment.
Besides console scripts, the header (i.e. until _logger...) of this file can
also be used as template for Python modules.

Note: This skeleton file can be safely removed if not needed!
